The app is still under development!

The application is designed to store books and track reading statistics for a particular book, such as the number of pages read per minute, length of reading sessions, etc. The app aims to help users develop a habit of reading by displaying a "reading streak," which indicates how many days in a row the user has read books without interruption. Users can start a reading session, turn off their phone, and when they finish reading, they can stop the session and input the page number they finished on. The app then uses this data to provide various statistics.
